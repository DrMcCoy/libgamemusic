Camoto: Classic-game Modding Tools

Camoto is a collection of utilities for editing (modding) "classic games",
those from the early to mid 1990s.

This is libgamemusic, one component of the Camoto suite.  libgamemusic is a
library that can read and write many different music file formats, with a focus
on formats used by DOS games.

The library exposes each file format as a long list of "events", such as
note-on, tempo change, pitch bend, and so on.  This event list can then be
manipulated if required, and then written out to a music file in the same or
another format.

An instrument list is also provided, which allows manipulation of each
instrument used in the song.  Current instrument types are General MIDI (patch
numbers), OPL register values (used by Adlib songs) and sampled instruments
(as used by mod/tracker formats.)

Metadata is available from each format handler to indicate whether it can
support all the events and instrument types, or whether saving in a particular
format will result in some loss of accuracy.

This library is still in the preliminary stages, so only music formats from
these games have been implemented:

  * Bio Menace (.imf)
  * Blake Stone (.wlf)
  * Commander Keen (.imf)
  * Cosmo's Cosmic Adventures (.imf)
  * Duke Nukem II (.imf)
  * Duke Nukem 3D (.mid)
  * Kiloblaster (.cmf)
  * Jill of the Jungle (.cmf)
  * Major Stryker (.imf)
  * Monster Bash (.imf)
  * Shadow Warrior (.mid) [shareware only]
  * Wacky Wheels (.mid)
  * Wolfenstein 3-D (.wlf)

Many more formats are planned.

The library is compiled and installed in the usual way:

  ./configure && make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig

If you downloaded the git release, run ./autogen.sh before the commands above.

This distribution includes an example program "gamemus" which serves as both
a command-line interface to the library as well as an example of how to use
the library.  This program is installed as part of the "make install" process.
See "man gamemus" for full details (note the manpage is currently documenting
intended behaviour, but not everything has been implemented yet.)

All supported music file formats are fully documented on the ModdingWiki - see

This library is released under the GPLv3 license.
