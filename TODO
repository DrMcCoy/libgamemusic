Outstanding tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Add parameter to generic OPL writer to blacklist channels, so the IMF writer
   can reserve channel 0 so it remains available for sound effects.

 - Normally it is assumed all OPL registers will be zero at the start of the
   output, so zero values aren't sent.  Add an option to set *all* registers
   before they are used for the benefit of songs which loop, so any changed
   instruments don't go funny when the song repeats.

 - Add a velocity value to the NoteOnEvent and use the OPL's volume register
   for this value (removing it from the instrument settings...maybe.)

 - Add support for multiple MIDI notes on the same channel

 - Currently no way of detecting which CMF instruments are destined for rhythm
   channels, thus converting a CMF with rhythm instruments to e.g. DRO will
   result in bad percussion due to the register settings being loaded into the
   wrong operator.

 - Scan CMF patches and set deep tremolo event if necessary

 - Support default CMF patches (e.g. for Word Rescue)

 - Recognise MIDI control event to change patches, not just patch-change event
